        <p>Cerdà&#x27;s Vision of Barcelona Today Central Barcelona is quite flat and easy to walk around. In fact, it’s a favorite thing to do for many of the 15 million who visit the city each year. The appeal of taking a pedestrian view of the city is enhanced by its design, which breaks large parts of the central space up into a grid of wide, straight roads, huge linking diagonals and square-ish neighborhood blocks. But, being easy for tourists to get around is not, of course, the core brief for any city’s urban designers; it’s not a mall or Disney world but a place where people live. The Catalonian capital may be a delight to visit, but many locals are unhappy about how the city actually works. Barcelona’s urban planning is the result of a well-thought-out concept, triggered by the demolition of the city’s medieval walls in the 1850s and 1860s. As outlined in a paper available at the Municipal Archive of Barcelona, massive overcrowding in the old city—the city itself dates back to around the second century BCE— required a modernization process to accommodate the growing population as well as new transport technology. Increasing mobility, reducing overcrowding and developing more efficient living arrangements were among the key factors on the table as Barcelona’s revitalization, known as the Eixample (Expansion), got underway. The ultimate design chosen was from Catalan architect and urban planner Ildefons Cerdà. According to researcher Nicholas Socrates (2009), his approach was based on an intricately calibrated grid system which incorporated a series of blocks of 113 square meters, linked by wide, tree-lined avenues, and was constructed to encourage a free flow of air and traffic. The blocks of multiple-floored living areas are shaved at 45 degrees on the corners, making them octagons, and are set north-west, south-east to catch light and breezes most effectively. In the interiors of the blocks are courtyard areas. Here, gardens and green areas were meant to be laid out for both sustainability (e.g. for growing vegetables) and general aesthetics and well- being to contribute to the life of the community. The streets were meant to be easily navigated with schools, shopping districts, and other neighborhood public spaces all within walking distance.</p>
        <p>As such, Cerdà’s vision covered health and hygiene, mobility, adaptation to modern motorized transport (the chamfered blocks ensured easier vision for vehicles at the corners), safety, walkability, flexibility, and it was set up for further development and population growth.</p>

        <p>It’s fair to argue that Cerdà’s plan represents a turning point in the development of what Cerdà himself termed “Urbanización” as a relatively new concept in dense, post-industrial social functionality and organization, and in the management of the modern city. Dr. Judith Urbano (2016) from the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya says that in rejecting other significant planning styles, such as the radial style which was commonly applied at the time, the national government in Madrid certainly displayed a sense of forward thinking. However, the very fact the decision was made in Madrid at all was to prove a fundamental downside to Cerdà’s plan in the century or so to come, as we shall see. Also important among Cerdà’s design agendas was a greater sense of social equality in Barcelona. As in any urban area, class structures had emerged in the city, and Cerdà felt that the city’s sustainability would be impacted negatively if this was to continue and become further entrenched.</p>
        <p>He believed his uniform, “de-classified” landscape would lessen the social divisions he saw as inimical to the city’s ability to thrive and grow in the future. As such, to Cerdà&#x27;s urban design progressiveness, we can add a sense of democratization as the basis for increasing populations, a view that was also revolutionary for its time. He is, as Urbano (2016) put it, “a pioneer” and is “recognized as the first urban planner in the modern sense.” The obvious question, almost 200 years later, is, has Cerdà’s vision worked? Not surprisingly, perhaps, one of the first challenges to Cerdà’s new city was its egalitarian vision. Marta Bausells (2016), in The Guardian, reported that almost straight away, homeowners and property developers were competing among themselves to stand out amid the restrictions of the city’s avowedly democratic urbanism. Members of the local Barcelona council (who had rejected Cerdà’s plan) were clearly feeling snubbed by the central government in Madrid overriding their objections. David Roberts (2019) noted in a Vox article that they were also beholden to some extent to powerful property owners. Whatever the reasons, local authorities failed to fully legislate to accommodate Cerdà’s plan. For instance, height and width limits on apartment blocks, set to ensure light, air, and movement were maximized for all, were largely ignored. Soon “super blocks” emerged, which overrode Cerdà’s uniformity and, says the Guardian’s Bausells, have become clear markers of class differences and social hierarchy. Protests around the Eixample have been ongoing for some decades in the city. Most recently, anti-tourism demonstrations have become a focal point of widespread disgruntlement about the commercialization of residential dwellings and the lack of property affordability for many locals living in the city. While these can actually be seen as widely supportive of Cerdà’s visions—in that many protesters would support his egalitarian aims—they are identifying perceived flaws in how the Eixample program has taken shape over the intervening years.</p>

        <p>More pointedly, anti-eviction campaigns have become a fairly regular event in the life of the city. Early in 2025, as reported in the local Catalan News, such a campaign in front of the Casa Orsola building—a well-known residential development—received a lot of publicity, which, according to an analysis in Le Monde, has become a symbol of many of the problems identified by civil groups. Local news outlet Ara reported in February that the building was eventually purchased from its private owners by the Barcelona City Council, with the view to halting evictions and to developing a more resident-friendly tenancy culture. Local media has highlighted other grassroots campaigns focusing on traffic bottlenecks and the need for more green spaces. Such activism has prompted the local authorities to take various actions in the last few years in an effort to alleviate the concerns and to address local agitation.</p>
        <p>The Council of the Eixample initiated a 37-point action plan at the end of 2024 for the space around the iconic Sagrada Familia. The program is intended to be a joint stakeholder process between authorities and residents and is designed to improve residential access and agency in the area. In the middle of 2025, the same municipality undertook a participatory residential ballot, which resulted in 8 initiatives being selected for government funding. Clearly, Barcelonistas have become fed up with perceived mismanagement and short-sightedness among officials, property owners, and lawmakers, in relation to the ongoing development of Cerdà’s original plans. The future of the city’s urban spaces rests to a large extent on how these tensions will be managed.</p>
